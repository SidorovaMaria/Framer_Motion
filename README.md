# ðŸŽ¬ Framer Motion x Next.js Playground

Welcome to my personal **Framer Motion + Next.js** playground!  
This repository is where I practice and showcase advanced UI/UX animations, transitions, and interactive interfaces using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) within the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

Whether itâ€™s micro-interactions, modal transitions, scroll animations, or page transitions, this is where I experiment and polish those details.
